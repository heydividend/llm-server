## 💡 Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Brokerage Statement Analysis
**User Action:** Upload Robinhood PDF statement  
**Harvey Response:**
```markdown
I found 12 holdings in your portfolio:

| Ticker | Shares | Current Value | Annual Dividend | Yield |
|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| AAPL   | 100    | $15,000       | $96.00          | 0.64% |
| MSFT   | 50     | $12,500       | $150.00         | 1.20% |
...

**Portfolio Metrics:**
- Total Value: $50,000
- Annual Dividend Income: $1,250
- Average Yield: 2.5%

Would you like me to:
1. Create a watchlist to monitor these holdings?
2. Calculate your TTM income with historical distributions?
3. Set up alerts for dividend cuts or price targets?
```

### Use Case 2: Dividend History Screenshot
**User Action:** Upload screenshot of dividend payment history  
**Harvey Response:**
```markdown
I extracted your dividend payments:

**AAPL Dividends (Last 4 Quarters):**
- Q4 2024: $24.00 (100 shares × $0.24)
- Q3 2024: $23.00 (100 shares × $0.23)
- Q2 2024: $24.00 (100 shares × $0.24)
- Q1 2024: $23.00 (100 shares × $0.23)

```

### Use Case 3: Excel Portfolio Tracker
**User Action:** Upload Excel file with portfolio holdings  
**Harvey Response:**
```markdown
I've analyzed your Excel portfolio:

**15 Holdings Detected:**
- High Yield: QYLD (10.5%), JEPI (8.2%), SCHD (3.5%)
