      "examples": [
        "CUSIP: 9-character alphanumeric code (e.g., 037833100 for Apple Inc.)",
        "Ticker: Short symbol used for trading (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.)",
        "CUSIPs are used for settlement and record-keeping, not trading",
        "Use ticker symbols when searching for stock prices or placing trades",

      "title": "Distribution vs Dividend - Tax Implications",
      "description": "Distributions and dividends have important differences, especially regarding tax treatment. Understanding these can help optimize your passive income strategy.",
      "examples": [
        "Qualified Dividends: From C-corps, taxed at favorable 0-20% rates",
        "Ordinary Dividends: Taxed at ordinary income rates (up to 37%)",
        "ROC (Return of Capital): Not immediately taxable, reduces cost basis",
        "REIT Distributions: Often mostly ordinary income, may include ROC",
        "MLP Distributions: Complex tax treatment with K-1 forms",
        "Tracking cost basis is critical for distributions with ROC components"
      ],
      "correction_template": "Note: REITs and MLPs pay distributions, not dividends. Distributions often include Return of Capital (ROC), which has different tax treatment than qualified dividends."

      "title": "High Yield Isn't Always Better",
      "description": "A very high dividend yield can be a warning sign rather than an opportunity. Understanding yield sustainability is crucial.",
      "examples": [
        "Extremely high yields (>10%) may indicate a recent price drop",
        "Price drops often signal dividend cut risk",
        "Check payout ratio - above 80% is concerning for most stocks",
        "Look at dividend growth history, not just current yield",
        "Sustainable 3-6% yields often beat unsustainable 10%+ yields long-term"
      ],
      "correction_template": "While high yields are attractive, yields above 8-10% often indicate elevated risk. Consider payout ratio, dividend history, and company fundamentals."

        "All dividends are taxable even if reinvested",
        "Manual reinvestment gives more control over timing and allocation",

      "examples": [
        "Must own stock BEFORE ex-dividend date to receive dividend",
        "Stock price typically drops by dividend amount on ex-date",
        "Declaration date ≠ Ex-date ≠ Record date ≠ Payment date",
        "T+1 settlement: Buy at least 1 day before ex-date",
        "Dividend capture rarely works due to price adjustment",
        "Focus on long-term holding, not short-term dividend capture"

        "0-40%: Conservative, room for growth",
        "40-60%: Balanced, sustainable for most companies",

        "80%+: Risky, potential dividend cut ahead",
        "REITs: Must pay 90%+ of taxable income, so high ratios are normal",
        "MLPs: Use distributable cash flow, not earnings"
