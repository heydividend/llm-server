To test a network connection, there are several tools and methods available, each serving different purposes and providing various types of information about the connection.

1. **Internet Speed Tests**: These tests measure the speed of your internet connection, typically focusing on download and upload speeds, as well as latency. Popular platforms for conducting speed tests include:
   - **Google Fiber Speed Test**: This service allows users to test their internet speed and compare it with Google Fiber's offerings, which range from 1 gigabit to 8 gigabits per second [1].
   - **Fast.com**: Developed by Netflix, this tool provides a simple interface to measure download speed, with additional options to view upload speed and latency [3].
   - **Speedtest by Ookla**: A widely used tool that measures download and upload speeds, ping, and provides a global index of internet speeds [4].

2. **Ping and ICMP Tests**: These tests are used to check the connectivity and latency between two devices on a network. The `Test-Connection` cmdlet in PowerShell is a versatile tool for this purpose:
   - **Test-Connection**: This PowerShell cmdlet sends ICMP echo request packets (pings) to one or more computers and returns the echo response replies. It can be used to determine if a computer can be contacted across an IP network. The cmdlet offers various parameters to customize the test, such as specifying the number of pings, setting a timeout, and choosing between IPv4 and IPv6 [2].

Each of these tools provides different insights into your network connection. Speed tests are useful for assessing the bandwidth and latency of your internet connection, while ping tests are more focused on connectivity and network path diagnostics. Depending on your needs, you might choose one or more of these tools to get a comprehensive understanding of your network's performance.
